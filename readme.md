# 3D Image Slider - CSS Only

This project showcases a **CSS-only 3D image slider**, demonstrating advanced CSS animations and layout techniques. It presents a stunning rotating image slider paired with stylized text content — all with no JavaScript involved.

## 🔥 Features

- 🎞️ 3D rotating image slider
- 🎨 Fully responsive design
- 💅 Modern and stylish look using custom fonts and grid background
- ⚙️ Pure CSS implementation (no JavaScript)
- ✍️ Designed by **Pratik Kumar Saurav**

## 📁 Project Structure

```
.
├── index.html         # Main HTML file
├── style.css          # CSS styles and animations
├── 1.jpg - 10.jpg     # Slider images (must be placed in the root directory)
├── bg.png             # Background image
└── model.png          # Stylized model image at the bottom
```

## 🖼️ How it Works

- The `.slider` div contains multiple `.item` elements.
- Each item is placed in a circular layout using `rotateY()` and `translateZ()`.
- The slider rotates continuously using a `@keyframes autoRun` animation.
- The `h1` heading and author's name are elegantly styled with `text-stroke` and custom fonts.

## 📦 Installation

1. Clone this repository or download the files.
2. Ensure the following images are placed in the project root:
   - `1.jpg` to `10.jpg`
   - `bg.png`
   - `model.png`
3. Open `index.html` in any modern browser.

## 📱 Responsive Design

- Fully adapts to screens of various sizes, including tablets and mobile devices.
- Image depth and text size adjust accordingly for smaller screens.
